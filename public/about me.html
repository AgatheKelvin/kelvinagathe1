<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I love the sea,reading and listenig to music. Every weekend I go for a walk to the nearest seaside from my place, it help me to 
  relax. Feeling the droplets of water while stearing at the sea with a cool breeze all around my body is peace for me. Reading 
  help me to gain more knowledge, so it an activity that I practicw regurlarly. The last is my favorite one, listening to music has 
  take so much place in my everyday life as I do it every day,in the mornig while commming to school,at the afternoon while comming 
  from school </p>
